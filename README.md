# Domain Storytelling with PlantUML

DomainStory-PlantUML uses [PlantUML](http://en.plantuml.com/) to describe and
document a domain story which was developed in a
[Domain Storytelling](http://www.domainstorytelling.org) workshop.

DomainStory-PlantUML includes macros for creating domain stories with PlantUML.

## Getting Started

At the top of your domain story PlantUML `.puml` file,
you need to include the `domainStory.puml` file
found in the root of this repository.

If you want to use the always up-to-date version in this repository, use the following:

```c#
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml
```

To be independent of any internet connectivity,
you can also download the file found in the root
and reference it locally with

```c#
!include path/to/domainStory.puml
```

After you have included `domainStory.puml` you can use the predefined macro
definitions for the domain story actors:

* `Person(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Group(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `System(name, [label], [color], [scale])`

As well as the domain story work items:

* `Document(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Folder(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Call(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Email(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Conversation(name, [label], [color], [scale])`
* `Info(name, [label], [color], [scale])`

In addition to these,
it is also possible to define system boundaries via`Boundary(name, [label])`.

Now let's create our first domain story:

```csharp
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml

Boundary(System) {
    Person(Alice)
    Conversation(weather)
    Person(Bob)
}

activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, with, Bob)
@enduml
```
